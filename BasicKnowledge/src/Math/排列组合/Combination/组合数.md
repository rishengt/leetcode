组合数定义：从n个不同的元素中任意取m个（m<=n)元素所有组合的个数，记为C(n,m), 同理，自己查  

计算公式：C(n,m) = A(n,m)/ A(m,m) = n! / ((n-m)!m!)

规定： C(n,0) = 1;

[LeetCode 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sorted-vowel-strings/)  
The problem is a variant of finding Combinations. Mathematically, the problem can be described as, given 5 vowels (let k = 5k=5), we want to find the number of combinations using only nn vowels.   
Also, we can repeat each of those vowels multiple times.  

In other words, from kk vowels (k = 5k=5), we can choose nn vowels with repetition. Denoted as k \choose n( 
n
k
​	
 ), the formulae for Combination with Repetition is given by,

k \choose n( 
n
k
​	
 ) = \frac{(k + n - 1)!}{ (k - 1)! n!}= 
(k−1)!n!
(k+n−1)!
