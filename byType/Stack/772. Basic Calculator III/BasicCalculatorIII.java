/**
 * Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.
 *
 * The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators , open ( and closing parentheses ) and empty spaces .
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 *
 * You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-2147483648, 2147483647].
 *
 * Follow up: Could you solve the problem without using built-in library functions.
